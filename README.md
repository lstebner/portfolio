# Portfolio

This site is my "portfolio" which means it's how I show case different things I work on. It's hosted at [lstebner.com](http://lstebner.com) and I encourage you to visit it and also inspect the code!

# Code

Of course, as a web engineer, I have to take pride in the code which powers the things I build. This site is very basic, but is currently powered off a node app I've been working on to make building sites like this one even easier. The core of thsi lives in the "app" directory and you can probably find your way around from there.

If you decide to re-use any of the ideas/code shown here, please share the credit! No on ever minds a good beer either :). 

# Issues

If you find issues with this site or have general feedback, please use the issues section here at github and please look for an issue you think may be unknown.
