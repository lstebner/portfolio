                        p Omlet's API Documentation was starting to look a bit outdated so I helped out to give it a facelift. The new docs were designed by Jon Victorino and I built them a package which included the working site and a way to easily update content so they could continue to use it going forward without needing me to make updates for them. The result was these beautiful, easy to use docs!

                        p Are the Giants playing today is a simple, one page site, that answers just that question. It is powered off of a Google spreadsheet which contains the schedule info and presents various different messages depending on if there is a game, if it's over and when the next scheduled game is. Useful for any SF Giants fan!

                        p 10 Dollar Gaming is a blog site that was created because I love playing all these games that many other people seem to overlook. I wanted to be able to tell people about them so this started off as a Wordpress blog, but is now on a custom platform I made that reads from flat files instead of a database. On top of development I also play these games and write all content for the site.
